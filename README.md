## A simple implementation of a trojan malware in python with a C2 ( command and control ) server

A Command and Control (C2) server communicates with malware typically over a network using various protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, UDP, or even DNS. The specific method of communication can vary greatly depending on the design of the malware and the C2 server.

Here's a simplified explanation of how a C2 server might send commands to malware:

The malware, once installed on a victim's machine, will attempt to establish a connection with the C2 server. This is often done at regular intervals, a behavior known as "beaconing".

The C2 server, upon receiving a connection from the malware, can send commands back to the malware. These commands are often encoded or encrypted in some way to avoid detection.

The malware receives the commands from the C2 server and decodes or decrypts them.

The malware then executes the commands on the victim's machine. This could involve actions like downloading additional malware, stealing data, or modifying system settings.

The results of the command execution (such as stolen data) may then be sent back to the C2 server by the malware.
